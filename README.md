Vonage Video API Network Test
====================

This repository contains sample code that shows how to diagnose if the client's call (publishing
a stream to a Vonage Video API session) will be successful or not, given their network conditions. The
network test can be implemented as a step the client runs before joining the session. Based on the
test results, the app can decide if the client should be allowed to publish a stream to the session
and whether that stream should publish video or use audio-only mode. The test is intended to be used in a
session that connects two clients in a one-to-one call.

The network test is supported in:

*  [Vonage Video API Android SDK 2.23 and newer](https://developer.vonage.com/en/video/client-sdks/android/overview)
*  [Vonage Video API iOS SDK 2.23 and newer](https://developer.vonage.com/en/video/client-sdks/ios/overview)

JavaScript clients should use the sample code found here:
https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-video-js-api-network-test.

## How does it work

The sample apps each do the following:

1. Connect to a Vonage Video API session and publish a test stream to a test session.

   Note that the published test stream would be visible to all clients connected to
   the session. For this reason, you should use a separate test session (with a unique
   session ID) for the network test.  Do not use the test session for your actual call.
   Use a separate Vonage Video API session (and session ID) to share audio-video streams between
   clients.

2. Subscribe to your own test stream for a test period.

   During the test period, the video quality will stabilize, based on the available network
   connection quality.

3. Collect the bitrate and packet loss statistics using the Network Stats API (see below).

4. Compare the network stats against thresholds (see below) to determine the outcome of the test.

Please see the sample code for details.

## Network Stats API

This API lets you dynamically monitor the following statistics for a subscriber's stream:

* Audio and video bytes received 

* Audio and video packets lost

* Audio and video packets received

This API is only available in sessions that use the Vonage Video API Media Router.

## Thresholds and interpreting network statistics

You can use the network statistics to determine the ability to send and receive streams,
and as a result have a quality experience during the Vonage Video API call.

Please keep in mind, every application's use case and every user's perception of the call 
quality is different. Therefore, you should adjust the default thresholds and timeframe in 
accordance with your use case and expectations. For example, the 720p, 30 fps video call 
requires a much better network connection than 320x480-pixel, 15 fps video. So, in that case,
you need to set much higher threshold values in order to qualify a viable end user connection.
Also, the longer you run the test, the more accurate the values you will receive will be. 
At the same time, you might want to switch between publishing video and audio-only, based on
your specific use case. 

The Vonage Video API Network Test is implemented as sample code to make it easier
for developers to customize their application logic.

Below are examples of the thresholds for popular video resolution-frame rate combinations.
The following tables interpret results (for audio-video sessions and audio-only sessions),
with the following quality designations:

* Excellent - None or imperceptible impairments in media

* Acceptable - Some impairments in media, leading to some momentary disruptions

### Audio-video streams

For the given qualities and resolutions, all the following conditions must met.

| Quality    | Video resolution @ fps | Video kbps  | Packet loss |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Excellent  | 1280x720 @ 30          | > 1000      | < 0.5%      |
| Excellent  | 640x480 @ 30           | > 600       | < 0.5%      |
| Excellent  | 352x288 @ 30           | > 300       | < 0.5%      |
| Excellent  | 320x240 @ 30           | > 300       | < 0.5%      |
| Acceptable | 1280x720 @ 30          | > 350       | < 3%        |
| Acceptable | 640x480 @ 30           | > 250       | < 3%        |
| Acceptable | 352x288 @ 30           | > 150       | < 3%        |
| Acceptable | 320x240 @ 30           | > 150       | < 3%        |

Note that the default publish settings for video are 640x480 pixels @ 30 fps in the
Vonage Video API iOS SDK. The default is 352x288 @ 30 fps in the Vonage Video API Android SDK.

You can calculate the video kbps and packet loss based on the video bytes received and
video packets received statistics provided by the Network Statistics API. See the sample app
for code.

The video resolutions listed are representative of common resolutions. You can determine support for
other resolutions by interpolating the results with the closest resolutions listed.

### Audio-only streams

For the given qualities, the following conditions must met.

| Quality    | Audio kbps | Packet loss |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Excellent  | > 30       | < 0.5%      |
| Acceptable | > 25       | < 5%        |

Note that you can calculate the audio kbps and packet loss based on the audio bytes received
and audio packets received statistics provided by the API. See the sample apps for code.

## Sample code

This repo includes sample code showing how to build a network test using the
Vonage Video API Android and iOS client SDKs. Sample code for the Vonage Video API JavaScript SDK
can be found here: https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-video-js-api-network-test. Each 
sample shows how to determine the the appropriate audio and video settings to 
use in publishing a stream to a Vonage Video API session. To do this, each sample app 
publishes a stream to a test session and then uses the Network Stats API to
check the quality of that stream. Based on the quality, the app determines what 
the client can successfully publish:

* The client can publish an audio-video stream at the specified resolution.

* The client can publish an audio-only stream.

* The client is unable to publish.

Each sample subdirectory includes a README file that describes how the app uses the network
stats API.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

* Why are the Vonage Video API Network Stats API values different from my Speedtest.net results?

  Speedtest.net tests your network connection, while the Network Stats API shows how
  the WebRTC engine (and Vonage Video API) will perform on your connection. 

* Why are the Network Stats API results inconsistent?

  The WebRTC requires some time to stabilize the quality of the call for the specific
  connection. If you will allow the network test to run longer, you should receive
  more consistent results. Also, please, make sure that you're using routed Vonage Video API session
  instead of a relayed on. For more information, see [The Vonage Video API Media Router and media
  modes](https://developer.vonage.com/en/video/guides/create-session#the-media-router-and-media-modes)

* Why the output values are really low even though my user is streaming Netflix movies?

  WebRTC is conservative in choosing the allowed bandwidth. For example, 
  if there is another high-bandwidth consumer on the network, WebRTC will 
  try to set its own usage to the minimum.

* The network test shows the "Excellent" (or "Acceptable") result, but the video still gets
  pixilated during the call.

  You can increase the required thresholds to better qualify the end user connection.
  Please keep in mind, the network connection can change overtime, especially on mobile devices
  with changing network conditions.

* Why do I get compilation errors on iOS or Android.

  You need to be using a recent and supported version of the Vonage Video API iOS SDK or Vonage Video API Android SDK.
